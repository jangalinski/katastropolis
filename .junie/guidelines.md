## Persist answers in a file

Whenever you give an answer, persist it in a file. Use this file (relative to the project root) as a template 
for the naming convention: `.junie/history/2025-11-06T2219-inject-properties-into-gradle-extra.md`. 
When we continue a session later, keep updating the existing file instead of creating a new one.
Use headers to separate different sessions.
