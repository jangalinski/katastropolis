### 2025-12-01 06:47 — Investigation: Gradle run exited with code 1

Context
- User saw: `Process 'command '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-21.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java'' finished with non-zero exit value 1`.
- Build itself succeeds; failure is at runtime during `main` execution.

Findings
- The most recent file under work appears to be `advent-of-code/src/main/kotlin/_2025/day01.kt`.
- In `main`, the function `read(test: Boolean)` maps each non-empty line like `L68` using:
  ```kotlin
  val (d, v) = it.split("""[LR]\d+""".toRegex(), 2)
  d to v.toInt()
  ```
- The regex `[LR]\d+` matches the entire string (e.g., `L68`). Splitting a string on a regex that matches the whole string produces empty parts (e.g., `["", ""]`). As a result, `v` becomes an empty string, and `v.toInt()` throws a `NumberFormatException`.
- This unchecked exception during `main` causes the Java process to exit with status code 1, which Gradle reports as the non-zero exit value.

Evidence (reasoning)
- Build succeeds locally (no compilation errors), so the failure is not a compile-time issue.
- The mapping logic will fail deterministically on the provided inline input list, since every line is of the form `[LR]\d+`.

Suggested Fix
- Parse the direction and value without splitting on a regex that consumes the whole string. Options:
  1) Use simple string ops:
     ```kotlin
     val d = it.first().toString()
     val v = it.drop(1).toInt()
     d to v
     ```
  2) Use a capturing regex and destructure matches:
     ```kotlin
     val m = """([LR])(\d+)""".toRegex().matchEntire(it)
       ?: error("Invalid token: $it")
     val (d, v) = m.destructured
     d to v.toInt()
     ```

Notes
- `read(test: Boolean)` currently hardcodes `if (true)` which ignores the `test` parameter. Consider implementing actual input switching later.

Conclusion
- The non-zero exit value is due to a runtime `NumberFormatException` in `_2025/day01.kt` while parsing lines like `L68`. Adjust parsing as shown above to resolve the crash.
